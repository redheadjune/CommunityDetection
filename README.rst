Community Library
=================

Community Library is a cumulation of data, known methods of community detection
on that data, developed methods, and experimental scripts for properties and
methods. 


 In particulaDeveloped methods include the Louvain Algorithm for linearity
maximization, JTODO expansion, JTODO parallel implementation.

To use the code::

    import

    run

Known Algorithms
================

We include code from previous methods for comparitive results:

* Louvain Algorithm for Modularity Maximization

* JTODO for Spectral Decomposition

*JTODO for Clustering

Developed Algorithms
====================

We have developed the code corresponding to new methods with the papers JTODO,
JTODO, JTODO.  They are outlined as:

* Louvain Algorithm for Linearity Maximization

* Expansion Algorithm for Parallel Implementations

* Evolution Algorithm for Community Evolution

Data Sets
=========

To provide a kick off point and the data to produce known results we include
several data sets.

Small Data Sets
---------------

Formatted data for the following small data sets:

* Football Network

* Karate Club

*JTODO

Large Data Sets
---------------

Formatted data for the following large data sets:

* Archivx data sets of (astrophysics, ....JTODO)

* JTODO


Contributors Section
====================

Contributors:

*June Andrews and John Hopcroft for ideas

*June Andrews for all new code

*JTODO for the modularity code

*JTODO for the spectral method code
