    dthresh : the threshold on the degree of which nodes to consider

    Notes
    -----
    I do not consider this to be a very good method.  The issue is that 1 node
    by itself does not provide interesting information in the graph - not even
    by including all of its neighbors.  Most seeds produced by this method are
    small or not dense.

    Finds all cliques in the graph (uses the networkx function, which is

    clique, removes that clique, runs modularity/linearity on the remaining
