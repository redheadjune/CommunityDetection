Community Library
=================

Community Library is a cumulation of data, known methods of community detection
on that data, developed methods, and experimental scripts for properties and
methods.  In particular known used methods include the Louvain Algorithm for
modularity maximization, JTODO for spectral decomposition, JTODO for cluster
comparison.... Developed methods include the Louvain Algorithm for linearity
maximization, JTODO expansion, JTODO parallel implementation.




Conributors:
June Andrews and John Hopcroft for ideas
June Andrews for all new code
JTODO for the modularity code
JTODO for the spectral method code
